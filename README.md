# Project Overview

This project is an electronic vehicle health check (eVHC) system that leverages Generative AI to automate vehicle inspection video assessments. The solution aims to deliver faster, more accurate evaluations and detailed score generation.

---

## Background

The "Video Check" system is an electronic vehicle health check (eVHC) solution. Technicians video-record necessary repairs and provide a quote. Traditionally, these videos were manually quality-checked as part of the Dealer Incentive program.

---

## Approach

The video assessment process now leverages Generative AI for automation. This approach delivers faster, more accurate evaluations and detailed score generation to streamline the review process.
